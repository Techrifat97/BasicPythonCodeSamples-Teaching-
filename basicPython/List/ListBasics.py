# list is a versatile and commonly used data structure. 
# It's an ordered collection of items (which can be of different types) and is mutable, 
# meaning you can change its content without changing its identity.  Like in string we need to change the variable name but not for list

MyList = [1, 2, "shaon", 4, 5] # creation of list
print(MyList)
print("\n")
print('ยง' * 50)

#How to access individual item in a list
MyListValue = MyList[0]
MyListValue2 = MyList[-3] # we can use minus as well but it will start from backward
print(MyListValue)
print(MyListValue2)
